# haptools-prs-sim
Using haptools to investigate factors affecting portability of PRSs

# download
Execute the following command.
```
git clone https://github.com/CAST-genomics/haptools-prs-sim
```
Example data for reproducing our results is available for download upon request.

# setup
The pipeline is written as a Snakefile which can be executed via [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io). For reproduciblity, we recommend installing version 7.14.0:
```
conda create -n snakemake -c conda-forge --no-channel-priority 'bioconda::snakemake==7.14.0'
```
We highly recommend you install [Snakemake via conda](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html#installation-via-conda) like this so that you can use the `--use-conda` flag when calling `snakemake` to let it [automatically handle all dependencies](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html#integrated-package-management) of the pipeline. Otherwise, you must manually install the dependencies listed in the [env files](workflow/envs/).

# execution
1. Activate snakemake via `conda`:
    ```
    conda activate snakemake
    ```
2. Execute the pipeline on the example data

    Locally:
    ```
    ./run.bash &
    ```

    or on the SDSC TSCC HPC:
    ```
    qsub run.bash
    ```

Log files describing the output of the pipeline will be created within the results directory. The `qlog` file contains a basic description of the progress of each rule. More detailed log information can be found in the `logs/` directory.

### Executing the pipeline on your own data
You must modify [the config.yaml file](config/config.yaml) to specify paths to your data before you perform step 2 above. Currently, the pipeline is configured to run on our example data, which reproduces the figures in our manuscript.

### If this is your first time using Snakemake
We recommend that you run `snakemake --help` to learn about Snakemake's options. For example, to check that the pipeline will be executed correctly before you run it, you can call Snakemake with the `-n -p -r` flags. This is also a good way to familiarize yourself with the steps of the pipeline and their inputs and outputs (the latter of which are inputs to the first rule in each workflow -- ie the `all` rule).

Note that Snakemake will not recreate output that it has already generated, unless you request it. If a job fails or is interrupted, subsequent executions of Snakemake will just pick up where it left off. This can also apply to files that *you* create and provide in place of the files it would have generated.

By default, the pipeline will automatically delete some files it deems unnecessary (ex: unsorted copies of a file). You can opt to keep these files instead by providing the `--notemp` flag to Snakemake when executing the pipeline.

Our directory layout follows [Snakemake's recommended structure](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/snakefiles/deployment.html#distribution-and-reproducibility).
